        Hello to all who views this website! My name is Adrianni Silvano, currently a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside studying Political Science with a pathway in Law and Society. I am currently 19 years old and will be turning 20 on June 11, 2021. I am interested in becoming a lawyer and working for clients in a legal capacity, whether as a legal consultant or litigator in court cases. In that regard, I am taking political science as my undergraduate major with the hopes of attending a major Law School in the United States. The skills one learns as a political scientist (especially in terms of critical thinking, reading, analysis etc.) will be of large help if I am to pursue a career as a lawyer. If I become a lawyer, I will be a third-generation member of my family all the way back to my grandfather, who was not only a lawyer but also a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).  As a first-year student, I had planned to become active in the job-hunting and learning about the legal field, but unfortunately, we are all still in a remote learning environment. Since we are still in the midst of this arduous pandemic, I have not had the opportunity to participate in legal internships or real workshops of the sort, but I hope that I will be able to once everything is back to normal. In terms of professional experience, I have had a job since I was 16. My first job was an amusement park in my city, where I served foods such as Churros, Hotdogs, Popcorn, and cotton candy to hungry visitors. While it was only a summer job, the company granted me lots of working hours and I learned a lot from that first job in terms of workplace etiquette and behavior. My second job was a Target store serving pizzas at the Pizza Hut mini store. My third job and first retail job lasted for a year at Party City, blowing up balloons selling party items and major holidays (Halloween, Christmas, Easter etc.). My fourth and current job is as a Retail Supervisor at DICKâ€™s Sporting Goods. While none of these jobs relate to what Iâ€™m studying for, working a job while in school has taught me valuable life lessons on the importance of time management and using your hard-earned money wisely. Working as a young teenager also gave me a chance to improve my communication skills especially when customer service is an important factor. When I can finally move to UCR, I will have more opportunities to look for jobs and internships in the political science/legal field. As a large city that is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area, there will likely be many opportunities for me in Riverside and beyond. It is my fervent hope that anyone who views this website will understand the many job experiences and activities I have participated in, what Iâ€™m capable of, and what I can bring to their company.<br><br>
